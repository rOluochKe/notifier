1. <b>Missing Imports:</b> In your `src/index.js`, you are using the `sendNotification` function, but it's not imported or defined in that file. You should import it at the top of the `src/index.js` file for it to work properly.

2. <b>Error Handling:</b> In the `src/index.js` file, when you catch an error in the `getDB` function, you log it but don't rethrow it or handle it in any meaningful way. Depending on the context and nature of the error, you should decide whether to rethrow the error or handle it more gracefully, possibly by returning a meaningful error response.

3. <b>Lack of Configuration:</b> Your Slack webhook URL is hard-coded in `src/notification.js`. It's a better practice to store such sensitive information in environment variables or configuration files. This will improve security and allow you to easily switch between different environments (e.g., development, production) without modifying your code.

4. <b>Magic Numbers:</b> You have hard-coded numbers like `86400000` in your code, which represents the number of milliseconds in a day. It's advisable to use named constants or configuration variables for such values to improve code readability and maintainability.

5. <b>Logging:</b> While you have some logging in place for error handling, you might want to add more detailed and structured logging throughout your code to help with debugging and monitoring.

6. <b>Error Handling in `sendNotification`:</b> The `sendNotification` function in `src/notification.js` uses `await webhook.send`, which can throw errors. You should handle these potential errors using try-catch or by returning promises with proper error handling.

7. <b>Error Handling and Retry Logic:</b> In the notification cycle, consider adding retry logic for sending notifications in case of transient errors (e.g., network issues with Slack). Additionally, you might want to log or handle errors more robustly.
